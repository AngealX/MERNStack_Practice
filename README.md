# MERNStack_Practice

Here is a practice MERN Stack website I created in my grad school web development course.

# Starting Up The Project

In order to start this project, you will need to first make sure you have the following downloaded on your computer:

- node.js (which you can download by searching node.js)

Next, you should open up the terminal in VS Code (or whatever IDE you are using) and then split the terminal in two (look at photos/screenshots below):

<br>
When you split the terminal into two, make sure to navigate one to the "client" folder and the other terminal to the "server" folder (as shown in the photo above)
<br>
Next, you will need to use the command "npm start" for both the server and client terminal. However, you should use "npm start" on the server terminal first until you see a confirmation notification (shown in image below):

<br>

After you see this certification on the server side, you type in "npm start" on the client:

If everything goes well, then you should be able to see this webpage:

# Showing A Full Run Of Site
At the beginning of the video, I will be showing data that is already in the MongoDB from the post I made in the website. Next, the video shows me inputting new information for the website post and showing how that new information will also be sent to the MongoDB as well. Lastly, I will show how users can press the three dots on their post so they can re-enter information and how that change will update in the MongoDB as well, then I will delete a post and show how that will also be deleted in the MongoDB as well.

Next two videos are together and shows what happens when you delete one of the cards and how that will delete the data of that card from the MongoDB(was taking up to much space to put all on one video)
