Here is a practice MERN Stack website I created in my grad school web development course.

# Starting Up The Project

In order to start this project, you will need to first make sure you have the following downloaded on your computer:

- node.js (which you can download by searching node.js)

Next, you should open up the terminal in VS Code (or whatever IDE you are using) and then split the terminal in two (look at photos/screenshots below):

<br>
When you split the terminal into two, make sure to navigate one to the "client" folder and the other terminal to the "server" folder (as shown in the photo above)
<br>
Next, you will need to use the command "npm start" for both the server and client terminal. However, you should use "npm start" on the server terminal first until you see a confirmation notification (shown in image below):

<br>

After you see this certification on the server side, you type in "npm start" on the client:
